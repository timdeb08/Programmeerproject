__Comments__
---
The usage of comments is useful as an explanation of what a specific piece of code does. If a third user is reading your code, the comments specify what it is actually doing. In my main code, I do write comments every time a new element is implemented. For example, when a new SVG- or legend-element is created. It usually contains a few words of explanation. All the code get well-organized by comments and easy to understand. Every comment starts with a space and a capital letter. Above a written comment has to be a white space.

__Tabs and spaces__
---
Tabs and spaces can be used to organize your code and make it easy to read. If a new function is implemented, the code inside the functions is indented with a tab. The same for if-statements and for-loops. I never use spaces as this doesn't work for me.

__Use of white space__
---
I use the white space when a new element or variable is implemented. White spaces are also implemented when I write a new comment. This makes it easily readable.

__Proper naming of variables and functions__
---
Proper naming makes it easy for a third user to understand what a specific variable or function does/contains. The name has to correspond to the action or to its usage. If I write a function to create the pie chart, the function is called "pieChart" or "createPiechart". This clarifies a function/variable on first sight.

__Code grouping__
---
Grouping means to slice up the program in different ways for better comprehension. I was doubting about whether to put my charts in different Javascript-files, but my code in total is about 600 lines so I thought this wasn't needed. I have one main Javascript-file with all the code for creating the visualizations. I have several CSS files corresponding to the HTML file. And every file is in the same doc.
