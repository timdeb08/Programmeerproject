The purpose of this project is to visualize the outcome of the last Provinciale Staten elections with a specific view on the huge gain of Forum voor Democratie. My research question is: Is there a possible cause of the political gain of Forum voor Democratie? In my research I discuss two variables which I assume can be the cause of the gain, which are the attendance rate and the standardized median income per municipality.

First, a map of the Netherlands is shown, where you can choose between the total votes on Forum voor Democratie and the winner in a specific municipality. Second, there is a pie chart which visualizes the political diversion in a specific municipality, with all the parties voted on. Last but not least, the scatterplot visualizes the municipalities per province where each dot represents a municipality. The x-as represents the attendance rate or standardized median income per municipality. The user can choose between these two variables using a dropdown-menu. On the y-axis the amount of votes on Forum voor Democratie is shown. The scatterplot can be used to find a possible correlation between two variables.
