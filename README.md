Name: Tim de Boer
Studentnumber: 11202351

The final project of the programming minor. For this project I will visualize the unemployment rates among youth, aged 17 till 25, per quarter of the corresponding year. Second, I will capture the differences in unemployment rates in relation with social benefits for every province in the Netherlands. Finally, I want to analyze the unemployment rates regarding to the education levels.

__Problem Statement__
Youth unemployment is a global problem which has the potential to have significant and serious social repercussions. Youth unemployment can lead to social exclusion and unrest. As the economy is rising after the Financial Crisis of 2007, the youth unemployment rate remains a serious problem. Offering decent education and training opportunities can help them to find a job. My question is: How can the youth unemployment rate be so significant? Is there a significant difference in unemployment rates between, for example, provinces and education levels in the Netherlands? And is the youth unemployment rate higher than the unemployment rate among adults? My aim is to visualize this problem and analyze whether the cause arises from education level or province.
