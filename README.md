This project visualizes the results of the last Provinciale Staten elections in the Netherlands, with a specific focus on the huge gain of the new political party Forum voor Democratie. The research question is as follows: Is there possible cause of the political gain of Forum voor Democratie? In this research, we will discuss two variables which I assume can be a cause of the gain which are the attendance rate and the standardized median income per municipality. All the visualization and datasets are on a municipal level, to give a more detailed view of the political situation and diversion in the Netherlands. Here is a link to the github page:
